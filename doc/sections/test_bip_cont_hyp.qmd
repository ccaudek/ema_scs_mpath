We used a hierarchical model designed to analyze data collected from multiple participants over several days, with each participant providing multiple measurements per day. The primary focus is on the relationship between Compassionate Self (CS) and Uncompassionate Self (UCS) scores, while accounting for participant-specific and day-specific variations, as well as variations in other covariates like negative affect, decentering, and context evaluation.

    \text{UCS}_{ijkm} &\sim t\left(\nu, \mu_{ijkm}, \sigma_{\text{UCS}}\right) \\
    \mu_{ijkm} &= \alpha_{\text{UCS}} + \left(\beta_{\text{CS}} + b_{i}^{\text{participant}}\right) \times \text{CS}_{ijkm} + \boldsymbol{\beta}_{\text{cov}}^\top \mathbf{X}_{ijkm} \\
    &\quad + u_{i}^{\text{participant}} + v_{j[i]}^{\text{day}} + w_{k[ij]}^{\text{measurement}} \\

    \sigma_{\text{UCS}}, \sigma_{\text{participant}}, \sigma_{\text{day}}, \sigma_{\text{measurement}}, \sigma_{\text{participant\_slope\_cs}} &\sim \text{Exponential}(1) \\

1. **Primary Equation (UCS Likelihood):** The UCS (Uncompassionate Self) score for each observation is modeled using a t-distribution. This choice accommodates potential heavy tails in the UCS score distribution. Each observation is indexed by participant $i$, day $j$, and measurement $k$, and the distribution is characterized by degrees of freedom $\nu$, a mean $\mu_{ijkm}$, and standard deviation $\sigma_{\text{UCS}}$.

2. **Mean Equation ($\mu_{ijkm}$):** The mean UCS score, $\mu_{ijkm}$, is calculated as a linear combination of several components:
   - A global intercept $\alpha_{\text{UCS}}$.
   - The product of a coefficient $\beta_{\text{CS}}$ (representing the overall effect of the CS (Compassionate Self) score) and the specific CS score for that observation.
   - The weighted sum of other covariates (negative affect, decentering, context evaluation), each multiplied by their respective coefficients $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{\text{cov}}$.
   - Random intercepts for each participant $u_{i}^{\text{participant}}$, day $v_{j[i]}^{\text{day}}$, and measurement $w_{k[ij]}^{\text{measurement}}$, accounting for the hierarchical data structure.
   - A random slope $b_{i}^{\text{participant}}$ for CS at the participant level, allowing the relationship between CS and UCS to vary across individuals.

3. **Random Effects:** 
   - Random intercepts for participants, days, and measurements (denoted as $u_{i}^{\text{participant}}$, $v_{j[i]}^{\text{day}}$, and $w_{k[ij]}^{\text{measurement}}$, respectively) are assumed to follow normal distributions with a mean of zero and specific standard deviations. These intercepts capture variability across the different levels of the hierarchical structure.
   - Additionally, the model includes a random slope for the effect of CS ($b_{i}^{\text{participant}}$) at the participant level. This element allows the model to capture individual differences in how CS influences UCS.

4. **Priors:** 
   - The model assumes normal distributions with mean zero for coefficients and intercepts, reflecting a lack of prior bias towards specific values. The standard deviations of the random effects and the error term ($\sigma_{\text{UCS}}$, $\sigma_{\text{participant}}$, etc.) are modeled using exponential distributions. The degrees of freedom parameter $\nu$ for the t-distribution is drawn from a gamma distribution, suggesting flexibility in the tail behavior of the UCS scores.

This statistical model is particularly suited for exploring the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis proposed by Neff, which posits an inverse relationship between UCS and CS across individuals. By including random slopes for CS at the participant level, the model can assess how this relationship varies among individuals, providing insights into the nuanced nature of self-compassion and self-criticism.
