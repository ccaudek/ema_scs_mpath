The construct of self-compassion, a central concept in contemporary psychology, has been the subject of much scholarly debate. Traditionally, researchers have grappled with whether self-compassion is best understood as a unitary construct, represented by a bipolar continuum ranging from uncompassionate self-responding (UCS) to compassionate self-responding (CS), or as a configuration of two partly independent components. This debate is vital as it shapes our understanding of self-compassion and its role in psychological well-being. 

Building on this discussion, recent advancements in psychological research have emphasized the dynamic nature of psychological constructs, suggesting that they are not static or solely trait-based, but rather can be influenced by situational factors. This perspective is critical in the study of state self-compassion, an evolution of the original construct of self-compassion, which encompasses moment-to-moment variations in self-compassionate feelings and attitudes. The development of scales to measure state self-compassion (e.g., Raes et al., 2011) provides a tool to explore this dynamism.

In our study, we aim to contribute to the ongoing discourse by examining how situational factors, such as negative affect, influence the UCS and CS components of state self-compassion. This approach is inspired by the shift in emotion regulation research, where the focus has moved from the frequency of using strategies to the context-dependent effectiveness of these strategies (Gross, 1998; Aldao et al., 2015). By investigating how different situational factors impact UCS and CS, we seek to provide empirical evidence to the theoretical debate on the nature of the self-compassion construct.

Our hypothesis is twofold: If situational factors affect UCS and CS in parallel but opposing ways (i.e., an increase in UCS corresponds with a decrease in CS), this would lend support to the bipolar continuum model of self-compassion, as proposed by Neff (2003). This model posits that self-compassion is a singular, unified construct with varying degrees of expression. Alternatively, if situational factors differentially influence UCS and CS (for instance, if a factor impacts CS but leaves UCS unaffected, or vice versa), this would suggest that self-compassion comprises two distinct components, aligning with the perspectives of researchers like Muris et al. (2016), who argue for the duality of the construct.

This exploration is crucial for a deeper understanding of self-compassion, as it not only contributes to theoretical knowledge but also has practical implications. Understanding the situational dynamics of self-compassion can enhance psychological interventions and promote well-being by identifying specific contexts in which self-compassionate or uncompassionate responses are more likely to be elicited. Such insights could be pivotal in developing more nuanced and effective therapeutic strategies that cater to individual differences and situational variables, ultimately fostering a more compassionate self-relationship in diverse life situations.

## The State Self-Compassion Construct

The concept of self-compassion, as defined by Kristin Neff, is indeed an interesting area to explore within the framework of psychological resilience. To address your question, it's important to first understand the distinct aspects of self-compassion and how they might fit into the resilience framework as proposed by Troy et al.

1. **Self-Compassion as a Trait (Factor)**: Neff's original concept of self-compassion is often viewed as a trait-like quality. It involves being kind and understanding toward oneself in instances of pain or failure, rather than being harshly self-critical; recognizing that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the shared human experience; and holding oneâ€™s painful thoughts and feelings in balanced awareness (mindfulness). This trait-like self-compassion aligns with the first conceptualization of resilience as a stable factor.

2. **State Self-Compassion**: More recently, Neff has introduced the concept of "State Self-Compassion." This concept recognizes that self-compassion can vary over time and in different situations, rather than being a fixed trait. It's about how individuals might exhibit self-compassionate reactions to specific events or circumstances.

Now, in terms of fitting this into the resilience framework:

- **As a Process**: State self-compassion could be conceptualized as a process, in the sense that it involves active, moment-to-moment regulation of emotional responses to stress or adversity. This is in line with the idea of resilience as a process, where resilience is not just about having certain traits, but also about how individuals actively cope with and respond to challenges. In this view, state self-compassion is a dynamic and context-dependent process through which individuals navigate difficult experiences.

- **As an Outcome**: Alternatively, state self-compassion could be seen as an outcome, particularly if we focus on the effects or results of being self-compassionate in specific situations. Here, the emphasis is on the beneficial outcomes (such as reduced anxiety, improved emotional well-being, etc.) that result from adopting a self-compassionate stance in response to personal struggles or failures.

In reality, state self-compassion may not fit neatly into just one of these categories. It could be argued that it acts both as a process and as an outcome. As a process, it involves the active engagement of self-compassionate attitudes and behaviors in response to specific situations. As an outcome, it refers to the immediate and long-term benefits that arise from these self-compassionate responses.

This dual conceptualization is not uncommon in psychological constructs, where a phenomenon can play a role in both the mechanisms of coping (process) and the effects of that coping (outcome). It may be most accurate to consider state self-compassion as a dynamic element within the broader resilience framework, influencing and being influenced by various factors and outcomes.

## The Role of the Context

The relationship between state self-compassion and contextual factors can be highlighted by observing how different types of events (e.g., minor vs. major stressors, personal failures, life changes) impact the self-compassion trajectory. For instance, individuals with higher trait self-compassion might show a quicker recovery in their state self-compassion following adversity, or they might not experience as significant a drop in the first place.
