*Decentering* and *self-compassion* are related constructs. Both constructs contribute to psychological well-being through slightly different mechanisms. Decentering aids in diminishing identification with negative thoughts and feelings, enabling individuals to observe them without judgment or automatic reactions. This detachment can create space for self-compassion to emerge, as individuals can acknowledge their challenging experiences with greater kindness and understanding. Self-compassion, in turn, can facilitate the decentering process by offering a gentler and more welcoming approach to difficult emotions and thoughts. When individuals can treat themselves with compassion, they may find it easier to observe their internal experiences without being overwhelmed. Self-compassion allows individuals to confront failures, mistakes, and self-criticism with kindness and understanding rather than judgment or reproach. This approach can facilitate decentering, as individuals learn to view such experiences as common to all humans, rather than reflections of their personal worth. Both decentering and self-compassion contribute to psychological resilience. Decentering helps maintain a more balanced and objective perspective, while self-compassion provides emotional support and a more positive response to challenges. Mindfulness plays a key role in connecting decentering and self-compassion. Mindfulness practice encourages both decentering and self-compassion by promoting non-judgmental observation of internal experiences and greater self-kindness.
