<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The construct of self-compassion, a central concept in contemporary psychology, has been the subject of much scholarly debate. Traditionally, researchers have grappled with whether self-compassion is best understood as a unitary construct, represented by a bipolar continuum ranging from uncompassionate self-responding (UCS) to compassionate self-responding (CS), or as a configuration of two partly independent components. This debate is vital as it shapes our understanding of self-compassion and its role in psychological well-being.</p>
<p>Building on this discussion, recent advancements in psychological research have emphasized the dynamic nature of psychological constructs, suggesting that they are not static or solely trait-based, but rather can be influenced by situational factors. This perspective is critical in the study of state self-compassion, an evolution of the original construct of self-compassion, which encompasses moment-to-moment variations in self-compassionate feelings and attitudes. The development of scales to measure state self-compassion (e.g., Raes et al., 2011) provides a tool to explore this dynamism.</p>
<p>In our study, we aim to contribute to the ongoing discourse by examining how situational factors, such as negative affect, influence the UCS and CS components of state self-compassion. This approach is inspired by the shift in emotion regulation research, where the focus has moved from the frequency of using strategies to the context-dependent effectiveness of these strategies (Gross, 1998; Aldao et al., 2015). By investigating how different situational factors impact UCS and CS, we seek to provide empirical evidence to the theoretical debate on the nature of the self-compassion construct.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis is twofold: If situational factors affect UCS and CS in parallel but opposing ways (i.e., an increase in UCS corresponds with a decrease in CS), this would lend support to the bipolar continuum model of self-compassion, as proposed by Neff (2003). This model posits that self-compassion is a singular, unified construct with varying degrees of expression. Alternatively, if situational factors differentially influence UCS and CS (for instance, if a factor impacts CS but leaves UCS unaffected, or vice versa), this would suggest that self-compassion comprises two distinct components, aligning with the perspectives of researchers like Muris et al.&nbsp;(2016), who argue for the duality of the construct.</p>
<p>This exploration is crucial for a deeper understanding of self-compassion, as it not only contributes to theoretical knowledge but also has practical implications. Understanding the situational dynamics of self-compassion can enhance psychological interventions and promote well-being by identifying specific contexts in which self-compassionate or uncompassionate responses are more likely to be elicited. Such insights could be pivotal in developing more nuanced and effective therapeutic strategies that cater to individual differences and situational variables, ultimately fostering a more compassionate self-relationship in diverse life situations.</p>
<section id="the-state-self-compassion-construct" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-state-self-compassion-construct">The State Self-Compassion Construct</h2>
<p>The concept of self-compassion, as defined by Kristin Neff, is indeed an interesting area to explore within the framework of psychological resilience. To address your question, it’s important to first understand the distinct aspects of self-compassion and how they might fit into the resilience framework as proposed by Troy et al.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Self-Compassion as a Trait (Factor)</strong>: Neff’s original concept of self-compassion is often viewed as a trait-like quality. It involves being kind and understanding toward oneself in instances of pain or failure, rather than being harshly self-critical; recognizing that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the shared human experience; and holding one’s painful thoughts and feelings in balanced awareness (mindfulness). This trait-like self-compassion aligns with the first conceptualization of resilience as a stable factor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State Self-Compassion</strong>: More recently, Neff has introduced the concept of “State Self-Compassion.” This concept recognizes that self-compassion can vary over time and in different situations, rather than being a fixed trait. It’s about how individuals might exhibit self-compassionate reactions to specific events or circumstances.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, in terms of fitting this into the resilience framework:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>As a Process</strong>: State self-compassion could be conceptualized as a process, in the sense that it involves active, moment-to-moment regulation of emotional responses to stress or adversity. This is in line with the idea of resilience as a process, where resilience is not just about having certain traits, but also about how individuals actively cope with and respond to challenges. In this view, state self-compassion is a dynamic and context-dependent process through which individuals navigate difficult experiences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>As an Outcome</strong>: Alternatively, state self-compassion could be seen as an outcome, particularly if we focus on the effects or results of being self-compassionate in specific situations. Here, the emphasis is on the beneficial outcomes (such as reduced anxiety, improved emotional well-being, etc.) that result from adopting a self-compassionate stance in response to personal struggles or failures.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In reality, state self-compassion may not fit neatly into just one of these categories. It could be argued that it acts both as a process and as an outcome. As a process, it involves the active engagement of self-compassionate attitudes and behaviors in response to specific situations. As an outcome, it refers to the immediate and long-term benefits that arise from these self-compassionate responses.</p>
<p>This dual conceptualization is not uncommon in psychological constructs, where a phenomenon can play a role in both the mechanisms of coping (process) and the effects of that coping (outcome). It may be most accurate to consider state self-compassion as a dynamic element within the broader resilience framework, influencing and being influenced by various factors and outcomes.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-role-of-the-context">The Role of the Context</h2>
<p>The relationship between state self-compassion and contextual factors can be highlighted by observing how different types of events (e.g., minor vs.&nbsp;major stressors, personal failures, life changes) impact the self-compassion trajectory. For instance, individuals with higher trait self-compassion might show a quicker recovery in their state self-compassion following adversity, or they might not experience as significant a drop in the first place.</p>

<p><em>Decentering</em> is a core construct encompassing three metacognitive processes: meta-awareness, disidentification from internal experiences, and reduced reactivity to thought content <span class="citation" data-cites="bernstein2019metacognitive">(<a href="#ref-bernstein2019metacognitive" role="doc-biblioref">Bernstein et al., 2019</a>)</span>. Its significance in mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) research has persisted for more than two decades, owing to its therapeutic role in Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy and its proposed role as a mediating mechanism across various MBIs. Decentering and self-compassion are both vital for psychological well-being and often mutually reinforce each other. The ability to observe one’s thoughts and feelings from a distance (decentering) can facilitate a more compassionate approach to oneself, and conversely, self-compassion can make adopting a decentered perspective more accessible (see SI). In the present study, decentering was measured with the ?? scale.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reliability-analysis-of-state-self-compassion-measures">Reliability Analysis of State Self-Compassion Measures</h2>
<p>We conducted a multilevel reliability analysis of the State Self-Compassion (SSC) scale, focusing on both its positive and negative components, by using the framework proposed by <span class="citation" data-cites="lai2021composite">Lai (<a href="#ref-lai2021composite" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>. For the <em>SC Component of SSC</em>, the Within-Subject Reliability (<span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\omega}^w\)</span>) was equal to 0.626, indicating moderate consistency in responses across different measurement occasions. This level of reliability reflects the variability in individuals’ self-compassionate responses over time. A higher reliability index of 0.820 was observed for the Between-Subject Reliability (<span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\omega}^b\)</span>), highlighting the measure’s effectiveness in distinguishing stable individual differences in self-compassion. Finally, the overall Composite Reliability (<span class="math inline">\(\omega^{2L}\)</span>) was 0.79, suggesting a reliable integration of both within and between-subject variabilities.</p>
<p>For the <em>USC Component of SSC</em>, slightly higher than the positive component, the Within-Subject Reliability (<span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\omega}^w\)</span>) was equal to 0.68. Markedly robust at 0.88, the Between-Subject Reliability (<span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\omega}^b\)</span>) indicates strong individual differentiation in the negative component of SSC. Finally, the Composite Reliability (<span class="math inline">\(\omega^{2L}\)</span>) for the negative component was 0.83, reinforcing the measure’s overall reliability.</p>
<p>In summary, the between-subject reliability indices for both components, particularly the negative one, surpass the benchmark of 0.8, suggesting the scale’s effectiveness in capturing stable individual differences in SSC. The within-subject reliabilities, while lower, are reflective of SSC as a dynamic construct. These values capture the natural fluctuation in self-compassion levels due to changing circumstances and internal states, highlighting the scale’s sensitivity to temporal variations within individuals.</p>

<section id="impact-of-exam-context-on-state-self-compassion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="impact-of-exam-context-on-state-self-compassion">Impact of Exam Context on State Self-Compassion</h2>
<p>In examining the effect of an academic exam on students’ State Self-Compassion (SSC), our Bayesian hierarchical model revealed robust contextual influences. Specifically, the model included random effects to account for variability across subjects, days, and within-day measurements, focusing on days immediately before (<code>exam_day_pre</code>) and after (<code>exam_day_post</code>) the exam.</p>
<p>On the day preceding the exam, there was a notable decrease in the CS component (posterior estimate for <code>beta_pre</code> contrast coefficient: -0.293; 89% CI: [-0.508, -0.080]; <span class="math inline">\(p(\beta)\)</span> &lt; 0 = 0.983). This suggests that the upcoming exam substantially lowered students’ compassionate self-responses. Conversely, the UCS component showed an increase before the exam (posterior estimate for <code>beta_pre</code>: 0.661; 89% CI: [0.380, 0.947]; <span class="math inline">\(p(\beta)\)</span> &gt; 0 = 1), indicating heightened self-criticism or reduced self-kindness in this stressful period. The day after the exam, we observed an increase in the CS component (posterior estimate: 0.228; 89% CI: [0.0187, 0.446]; <span class="math inline">\(p(\beta)\)</span> &gt; 0 = 0.959) and a decrease in the UCS component (posterior estimate: -0.666; 89% CI: [-0.946, -0.392]; <span class="math inline">\(p(\beta)\)</span> &lt; 0 = 1), suggesting a rebound in self-compassion following the stressor.</p>
<p>These results underline the dynamic nature of SSC in relation to situational stressors. The decrease in CS and increase in UCS components prior to the exam align with literature on the impact of stress on self-compassion. Interestingly, the post-exam period shows a reversal in these trends, indicating a recovery in self-compassion levels. This highlights the importance of temporal context in understanding the fluctuations in self-compassion among students. Overall, these insights are crucial for developing interventions aimed at enhancing resilience and self-compassion in academic settings, especially during periods of heightened stress.</p>
<section id="impact-of-exam-context-on-negative-affect" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="impact-of-exam-context-on-negative-affect">Impact of Exam Context on Negative Affect</h3>
<p>We also found a large effect of academic examinations on students’ negative affect. Specifically, we observed a pronounced decrease in negative affect from the day before to the day after the exams. This pattern was consistent across two separate examinations. For the first exam, we found a substantial standardized decrease in negative affect on the day following the exam, relative to the day prior.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="temporal-dynamics-of-state-self-compassion-contextual-influence-of-negative-affect">Temporal Dynamics of State Self-Compassion: Contextual Influence of Negative Affect</h3>
<p>We explored the temporal dynamics of State Self-Compassion (SSC), examining how fluctuations in negative affect influence its Compassionate (CS) and Uncompassionate (USC) components. We hypothesized that these components are dynamically affected by immediate affective states and their changes over time. To investigate this, we employed two Bayesian hierarchical models, each addressing one component of SSC and incorporating both current and preceding levels of negative affect.</p>
<p>The models were formulated as follows: for the CS component, <code>sc ~ neg_aff + delta_neg_aff + time_window + (1 + neg_aff + delta_neg_aff | user_id) + (1 | bysubj_day) + (1 | bysubj_day:time_window) + ar(time = time_window, gr = user_id:bysubj_day, p = 1, cov = TRUE)</code>; and similarly for the USC component. Here, <code>neg_aff</code> represents the level of negative affect at the measurement time, while <code>delta_neg_aff</code> quantifies the change in negative affect from the previous to the current time point within the same day. The inclusion of these predictors allowed us to assess the ‘carry-over’ effect of negative affect on SSC.</p>
<p>For the CS component, our model revealed a robust inverse relationship between negative affect and CS (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = -0.42, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.03; 89% CI: [-0.47, -0.36]). This suggests that higher negative affect at the time of measurement corresponded with lower levels of CS. An increase in negative affect relative to the previous measurement within the same day (β = 0.04, SE = 0.01; 89% CI: [0.02, 0.06]) was associated with a modest increase in CS, highlighting temporal adaptation in self-compassion. The model also indicated a moderate degree of temporal autocorrelation (ar[1] = 0.30), suggesting some stability in CS responses over short periods.</p>
<p>Conversely, the USC component analysis showed that increased negative affect was associated with heightened USC (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = 0.43, SE = 0.03). An increase in negative affect over time led to a slight decrease in USC (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = -0.04, SE = 0.01; ; 89% CI: [-0.05, -0.02]), suggesting a different adaptive response compared to CS. The USC component also exhibited a stronger autoregressive effect (ar[1] = 0.34), indicating a more pronounced carry-over effect of affective states.</p>
<p>These findings highlight the dynamic nature of SSC, where both CS and USC are influenced by the immediate affective context. The identified ‘carry-over’ effect of negative affect reinforces SSC’s fluidity, where short-term affective shifts can significantly impact self-compassion expressions. The differential responses in CS and USC to temporal affective changes underscore the complex and nuanced interplay between affective states and self-compassion facets.</p>

<p>NOTES:</p>
<p><code>delta_neg_aff</code> has been computed as the difference in neg_aff (negative affect) between successive time points within each day for each user. This means <code>delta_neg_aff</code> represents the change in negative affect from one measurement to the next on the same day.</p>
<p>Given your additional details about how <code>delta_neg_aff</code> was computed and the nature of <code>time_window</code>, the interpretation of your model results should be slightly adjusted. Here’s the refined interpretation:</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overall-interpretation">Overall Interpretation</h3>
<p>The results indicate that variations in negative affect (delta_neg_aff) can predict subsequent changes in both the positive and negative components of state self-compassion (psc and nsc). However, changes in state self-compassion (both psc and nsc) do not predict subsequent changes in negative affect. This pattern supports the hypothesis that it is the change in the affective context that modulates state self-compassion, rather than changes in state self-compassion determining the variation in the affective response. It’s important to remember that Granger Causality Tests are about predictability, not true causation. While these results suggest a predictive relationship, they do not confirm a causal effect. This analysis suggests that the affective state, as it evolves, is a significant factor influencing how individuals engage in self-compassion practices.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="effects-of-contextual-factors-on-ssc">Effects of Contextual Factors on SSC</h3>
<p>Next, we examined the influence of three contextual factors – negative affect, decentering, and subjective evaluations of recent events (context) – on both the State Self-Compassion (SC) and Unstate Self-Compassion (USC) components. To investigate these effects comprehensively, we applied three distinct centering techniques: <em>Person Centering</em>, <em>Day Centering</em>, and <em>Moment Centering</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Person Centering</strong> ({{varname}}_Person): This method accounted for individual differences by computing the mean of {{varname}} for each person across all days and moments, revealing how their experiences deviated from the group average.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Day Centering</strong> ({{varname}}_Day): Focusing on {{varname}} variations within each day, we centered the data by calculating the daily mean across all moments. This allowed us to explore how daily fluctuations in {{varname}} related to the outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Moment Centering</strong> ({{varname}}_Moment): This approach honed in on within-day variations, measuring {{varname}} deviations from the daily mean at each moment. It provided insights into the immediate impact of {{varname}} within daily contexts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These centering techniques facilitated the consideration of individual, daily, and momentary variations in negative affect, decentering, and context evaluations. We employed a Bayesian multilevel model to predict the CS and UCS components of State Self-Compassion across participants, days, and moments within a day. The model incorporated the three contextual factors, each decomposed into its within-person, between-day, and between-person components. Various model iterations emphasized the significance of these components and different random-effect structures in contributing to model fit (Table 1).</p>

<p>Focusing on population-level effects, the model applied to the SC component of SSC revealed the following associations (for more detailed information, see Supplementary Information):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Decentering</strong>: Momentary (β = -0.12), daily (β = -0.18), and person-level (β = -0.37) decentering demonstrated negative relationships with the negative component of State Self-Compassion. This suggests that higher levels of decentering are linked to lower self-criticism or negative self-judgment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Negative Affect</strong>: Momentary (β = 0.13) and day-level (β = 0.17) negative affect exhibited positive associations with the negative component, while person-level negative affect (β = 0.34) showed a stronger positive relationship. This indicates that both transient and enduring negative emotions contribute to increased self-criticism.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Context Valence</strong>: Momentary context valence showed a weak negative association (β = -0.02), while daily (β = 0.01) and person-level context valence (β = 0.04) had minimal or slightly positive associations. This suggests that immediate context’s perceived negativity might slightly increase self-critical thoughts.</p></li>

<p>cor(dec_moment,dec_day) = 0.46: This is the correlation between the random effects for decentering at the moment level and the day level within the same individual. A positive correlation of 0.46 suggests that there is a moderate relationship between the variability in decentering across different days and within a single day for the same participant. In simpler terms, if a participant shows considerable variation in their decentering scores from day to day, they are also likely to show noticeable variation in decentering at different moments within the same day.</p>
<p>cor(na_moment,na_day) = 0.52: This coefficient represents the correlation between the random effects for negative affect at the moment level and the day level within the same individual. Similarly to the previous coefficient, a positive correlation of 0.52 indicates a moderate to strong relationship. It means that participants who tend to vary a lot in their negative affect scores between days are also likely to exhibit significant variation within a single day.</p>
<p>These correlations are important in understanding the dynamics of the psychological constructs you are studying (decentering and negative affect) in relation to time (both across days and within a single day).

<p>To test the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis of Neff, which posits a reciprocal relationship between the compassionate (CS) and uncompassionate (UCS) components of state self-compassion, a hierarchical Bayesian model was implemented using Stan. Our data comprised measurements from 169 participants, each assessed up to five times a day across up to sixteen days, yielding a total of N observations. Additionally, each measurement occasion included assessments of momentary negative affect, decentering, and valence evaluation of the context.</p>
<p>The model accounts for the hierarchical nature of the data, with observations nested within multiple levels: measurements, days, and participants. This structure allows for the analysis of within-person variability over time and across different conditions. The model estimates fixed effects for the intercept of UCS (alpha_ucs), the overall effect of CS on UCS (beta_cs), and coefficients for the three covariates: negative affect, decentering, and context evaluation (beta_covariates). To capture individual differences and temporal fluctuations, the model includes random intercepts for participants (z_participant), days (z_day), and measurements (z_measurement). Additionally, it estimates random slopes for the effect of CS at the participant level (z_participant_slope_cs).</p>

<section id="general-discussion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-discussion">General Discussion</h2>
<p>The construct of self-compassion, a central concept in contemporary psychology, has been the subject of much scholarly debate. Traditionally, researchers have grappled with whether self-compassion is best understood as a unitary construct, represented by a bipolar continuum ranging from uncompassionate self-responding (UCS) to compassionate self-responding (CS), or as a configuration of two partly independent components. This debate is vital as it shapes our understanding of self-compassion and its role in psychological well-being.</p>
<p>Building on this discussion, recent advancements in psychological research have emphasized the dynamic nature of psychological constructs, suggesting that they are not static or solely trait-based, but rather can be influenced by situational factors. This perspective is critical in the study of state self-compassion, an evolution of the original construct of self-compassion, which encompasses moment-to-moment variations in self-compassionate feelings and attitudes. The development of scales to measure state self-compassion (e.g., Raes et al., 2011) provides a tool to explore this dynamism.</p>
<p>In our study, we aim to contribute to the ongoing discourse by examining how situational factors, such as negative affect, influence the UCS and CS components of state self-compassion. This approach is inspired by the shift in emotion regulation research, where the focus has moved from the frequency of using strategies to the context-dependent effectiveness of these strategies (Gross, 1998; Aldao et al., 2015). By investigating how different situational factors impact UCS and CS, we seek to provide empirical evidence to the theoretical debate on the nature of the self-compassion construct.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis is twofold: If situational factors affect UCS and CS in parallel but opposing ways (i.e., an increase in UCS corresponds with a decrease in CS), this would lend support to the bipolar continuum model of self-compassion, as proposed by Neff (2003). This model posits that self-compassion is a singular, unified construct with varying degrees of expression. Alternatively, if situational factors differentially influence UCS and CS (for instance, if a factor impacts CS but leaves UCS unaffected, or vice versa), this would suggest that self-compassion comprises two distinct components, aligning with the perspectives of researchers like Muris et al.&nbsp;(2016), who argue for the duality of the construct.</p>
<p>This exploration is crucial for a deeper understanding of self-compassion, as it not only contributes to theoretical knowledge but also has practical implications. Understanding the situational dynamics of self-compassion can enhance psychological interventions and promote well-being by identifying specific contexts in which self-compassionate or uncompassionate responses are more likely to be elicited. Such insights could be pivotal in developing more nuanced and effective therapeutic strategies that cater to individual differences and situational variables, ultimately fostering a more compassionate self-relationship in diverse life situations.</p>

<section id="the-state-self-compassion-construct-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-state-self-compassion-construct-1">The State Self-Compassion Construct</h2>
<p>The concept of self-compassion, as defined by Kristin Neff, is indeed an interesting area to explore within the framework of psychological resilience. To address your question, it’s important to first understand the distinct aspects of self-compassion and how they might fit into the resilience framework as proposed by Troy et al.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Self-Compassion as a Trait (Factor)</strong>: Neff’s original concept of self-compassion is often viewed as a trait-like quality. It involves being kind and understanding toward oneself in instances of pain or failure, rather than being harshly self-critical; recognizing that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the shared human experience; and holding one’s painful thoughts and feelings in balanced awareness (mindfulness). This trait-like self-compassion aligns with the first conceptualization of resilience as a stable factor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State Self-Compassion</strong>: More recently, Neff has introduced the concept of “State Self-Compassion.” This concept recognizes that self-compassion can vary over time and in different situations, rather than being a fixed trait. It’s about how individuals might exhibit self-compassionate reactions to specific events or circumstances.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, in terms of fitting this into the resilience framework:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>As a Process</strong>: State self-compassion could be conceptualized as a process, in the sense that it involves active, moment-to-moment regulation of emotional responses to stress or adversity. This is in line with the idea of resilience as a process, where resilience is not just about having certain traits, but also about how individuals actively cope with and respond to challenges. In this view, state self-compassion is a dynamic and context-dependent process through which individuals navigate difficult experiences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>As an Outcome</strong>: Alternatively, state self-compassion could be seen as an outcome, particularly if we focus on the effects or results of being self-compassionate in specific situations. Here, the emphasis is on the beneficial outcomes (such as reduced anxiety, improved emotional well-being, etc.) that result from adopting a self-compassionate stance in response to personal struggles or failures.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In reality, state self-compassion may not fit neatly into just one of these categories. It could be argued that it acts both as a process and as an outcome. As a process, it involves the active engagement of self-compassionate attitudes and behaviors in response to specific situations. As an outcome, it refers to the immediate and long-term benefits that arise from these self-compassionate responses.</p>
<p>This dual conceptualization is not uncommon in psychological constructs, where a phenomenon can play a role in both the mechanisms of coping (process) and the effects of that coping (outcome). It may be most accurate to consider state self-compassion as a dynamic element within the broader resilience framework, influencing and being influenced by various factors and outcomes.</p>

<section id="the-role-of-the-context-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-role-of-the-context-1">The Role of the Context</h2>
<p>The relationship between state self-compassion and contextual factors can be highlighted by observing how different types of events (e.g., minor vs.&nbsp;major stressors, personal failures, life changes) impact the self-compassion trajectory. For instance, individuals with higher trait self-compassion might show a quicker recovery in their state self-compassion following adversity, or they might not experience as significant a drop in the first place.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="relation-between-decentering-and-self-compassion">Relation between Decentering and Self-compassion</h2>
<p><em>Decentering</em> and <em>self-compassion</em> are related constructs. Both constructs contribute to psychological well-being through slightly different mechanisms. Decentering aids in diminishing identification with negative thoughts and feelings, enabling individuals to observe them without judgment or automatic reactions. This detachment can create space for self-compassion to emerge, as individuals can acknowledge their challenging experiences with greater kindness and understanding. Self-compassion, in turn, can facilitate the decentering process by offering a gentler and more welcoming approach to difficult emotions and thoughts. When individuals can treat themselves with compassion, they may find it easier to observe their internal experiences without being overwhelmed. Self-compassion allows individuals to confront failures, mistakes, and self-criticism with kindness and understanding rather than judgment or reproach. This approach can facilitate decentering, as individuals learn to view such experiences as common to all humans, rather than reflections of their personal worth. Both decentering and self-compassion contribute to psychological resilience. Decentering helps maintain a more balanced and objective perspective, while self-compassion provides emotional support and a more positive response to challenges. Mindfulness plays a key role in connecting decentering and self-compassion. Mindfulness practice encourages both decentering and self-compassion by promoting non-judgmental observation of internal experiences and greater self-kindness.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Observational Unit and Data Structure:</strong> The model is built for <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> observations, collected from <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> subjects across <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> days, with each day comprising <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> measurements. The dependent variable, <code>CS</code> or <code>UCS</code>, represents the psychological measure of interest, and the primary predictors are binary indicators for pre-exam (<code>exam_day_pre</code>) and post-exam (<code>exam_day_post</code>) days.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Random Effects Structure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject-level Random Intercepts (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha_j\)</span>):</strong> These capture the subject-specific deviations from the overall mean, allowing for individual baseline differences in <code>CS</code> or <code>UCS</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Day-level Random Intercepts (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha_d\)</span>):</strong> These account for day-to-day variability within subjects, capturing fluctuations in <code>CS</code> or <code>UCS</code> that might be attributed to daily factors.</li>
<li><strong>Measurement-level Random Intercepts (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha_m\)</span>):</strong> These intercepts address the variation within the same day, considering the potential impact of the time of measurement on <code>CS</code> or <code>UCS</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Random Slopes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject-specific Slopes for Exam Days (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_{j\_pre}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{j\_post}\)</span>):</strong> These slopes allow the effect of pre- and post-exam days to vary across subjects, acknowledging that the impact of these specific days on <code>CS</code> or <code>UCS</code> might differ among individuals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Fixed Effects:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global Intercept (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>):</strong> This represents the overall mean level of <code>CS</code> or <code>UCS</code> across all observations when other predictors are at their reference levels.</li>
<li><strong>Main Effects for Exam Days (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_{pre}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{post}\)</span>):</strong> These coefficients estimate the average effect of pre- and post-exam days on <code>CS</code> or <code>UCS</code>, relative to non-exam days.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Skewness Parameter:</strong> The inclusion of a skewness parameter in the skew normal distribution allows the model to capture potential asymmetry in the distribution of <code>CS</code> or <code>UCS</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priors:</strong> The model employs non-informative priors for most parameters, assuming normal distributions for intercepts and slopes, and exponential distributions for standard deviations, ensuring a broad range of plausible values.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Likelihood:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> The response variable <code>CS</code> or <code>UCS</code> for each observation is modeled using a skew normal distribution, with mean and variance parameters constructed from the fixed and random effects, and the skewness parameter to capture asymmetry.</li>

<p>In our analysis, we conducted a model selection process aimed at identifying the most appropriate random-effect and fixed-effect structures tailored to our dataset. Our approach commenced by exploring the full fixed-effect structure and proceeded with a systematic comparison of models featuring varying degrees of random-effect complexity. Once we determined the optimal random-effect structure, we turned our attention to assessing models with different fixed-effects configurations. To facilitate this thorough model comparison, we harnessed the Leave-One-Out (LOO) method, a robust Bayesian model selection technique implemented within Stan.</p>

<p>The model comparison, utilizing the LOO method, clearly suggests that there is no valid justification for employing a random-effect structure more complex than participant-level clustering. In other words, the simpler approach of clustering at the participant level provides an adequate representation for our data, as evidenced by the minimal improvements gained from more intricate random-effect structures.</p>

<p>Our evaluation of random-effect structures using the LOO method yielded results consistent with those observed for the SC component. The model comparison for USC indicates that there is no compelling justification for employing a random-effect structure more complex than clustering at the participant level. This echoes the findings from the SC component analysis, where participant-level clustering proved sufficient to adequately represent our data. In both cases, more intricate random-effect structures did not significantly improve model performance.</p>

<p>When considering fixed-effect structures for the USC component, our analysis identified ‘Model 1: Full Fixed Effects’ as the best-fitting model. This model exhibited the highest estimated log pointwise predictive density (elpd_loo) and the lowest Leave-One-Out Information Criterion (looic) among the options.

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="explanation-of-the-model">Explanation of the Model</h4>
<p>This hierarchical Bayesian model is designed to investigate the relationship between the components of self-compassion (CS and UCS) and their interaction with other psychological variables (negative affect, decentering, and context evaluation). The model allows for both fixed and random effects, capturing the variability at the level of individual participants, days, and measurements. The use of a t-distribution for UCS accommodates the potential presence of outliers and ensures robustness. The inclusion of random slopes for the effect of CS allows us to examine how this relationship varies across individuals.</p>
